# Flatmates Bill Web-App

We're building a web app which allows us to split a bill in two parts, depending on the number of days each person stayed in the house.

## Pages of the web app
1. Home page
2. Bill Form page
3. Results page

## The classes
We're going to use the files we already built in the first implementation of the flatmate's bill app. And we're going to use three extra classes for the three screens we're going to build with flask.

We're also going to have a bill form class.
